# Timetabled
 This project is a grid-style weekly calendar that schedules one-hour events throughout a single week. The calendar is designed for someone elseâ€”whether it's a friend, family member, historical figure, role model, or even an imaginary character. The timetables can be informative, humorous, or exploratory, depending on the intended user.
